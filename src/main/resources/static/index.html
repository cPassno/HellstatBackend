<h1>Welcome to Hellstat</h1>
<p>My name is Colin Passno, and Hellstat was a senior project for my BAS in software development.
    <p>You can use the links at the top of the page to view the data I've collected for this project, organized either for an individual planet, or cumulatively
    for the three factions. There is also a recording of my final presentation for this project.</p>
</p>
<p>Hellstat is a website that collects and displays various statistics about the current state of the game Helldivers 2.
    A program collects information like player counts and kills from several APIs and stores that information in a database.
    The website then displays this information to the user, along with some statistics, like Kill/death ratios and player spread.
    This project is hosted entirely on Amazon Web Services, and consists of a Lambda function, RDS database, and EC2 instance.</p>

    <p>The Lambda function executes three external API calls and writes to the database, and is written in Node.js.
    The database itself is a simple MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS.
    The website is hosted on an EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2023.
    The webserver is a java springboot application that both serves
    the HTML and JS files that make up the website and hosts
    API endpoints for accessing the databaseâ€™s information.</p>
